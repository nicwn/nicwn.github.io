The Speedrun Ethereum challenges are a great way to level up Solidity development skills, especially when working with Scaffold-ETH. I embarked on this journey to gain hands-on experience with smart contracts and decentralized applications. These challenges are designed to introduce developers to fundamental concepts in Ethereum development, with practical implementations and tests. I've been using the challenges repository forked [here](https://github.com/nicwn/se-2-challenges) to complete each challenge.

Instead of focusing purely on technical solutions, I want to share my approach and thought process for each challenge. This journey involves understanding the rationale behind Solidity code, interacting with smart contracts, and building decentralized applications from scratch. You can follow along as I tackle these challenges.

For example, in one of the challenges, I worked on the `RiggedRoll.sol` contract, where the goal is to exploit vulnerabilities in a dice roll game. These exercises are excellent for sharpening security awareness in Ethereum development. You can find my repository and progress [here](https://github.com/nicwn/se-2-challenges). Stay tuned for updates as I continue to work through the challenges and reflect on my Solidity development journey.
